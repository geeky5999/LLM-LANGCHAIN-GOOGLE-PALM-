# LLM-LANGCHAIN-GOOGLE-PALM
 This is an end to end LLM project based on Google Palm and Langchain. I am building a Q&A system for an e-learning company that sells data related courses and bootcamps. They have thousands of learners who uses discord server or email to ask questions. This system will provide a streamlit based user interface for students where they can ask questions and get answers.
